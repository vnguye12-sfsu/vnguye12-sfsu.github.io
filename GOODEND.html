            <h3>ESCAPE HRVST</h3>

            <p>You successfully arrive back on ground level, this elevator has taken you to an untouched part of the facility. There is an exit door that leads directly in the woods. You and the ten girls traverse quickly and quietly to the recon point. Your sister is holding your hand.

Mission complete.
    
    <BR><BR>You've received the good ending.
