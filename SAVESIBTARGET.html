            <h3>ATTEMPT TO SAVE ALL</h3>

            <p>You make an executive decision to not follow mission orders. You realize all these girls have families outside of this building, and they are all worth saving. As you gather the girls and start moving towards your exit route it takes longer than you expected.
<BR><BR>
The alarms start ringing, you can hear guards running towards your location. You are in trouble.
