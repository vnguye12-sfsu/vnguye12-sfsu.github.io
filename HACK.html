            <h3>ATTEMPT TO HACK</h3>

            <p>You lean to the side and see a sticky note with a series of numbers and names jotted down. You think that it could be the password, but they can't possibly be this dumb.  You stare at the list for a minute and notice familiar names. From your previous intel it seems to be names of higher ups. You realize one of the founders is on there followed by a string of numbers. 
                
                <br><br>There's also second sticky note that reads "HRVSTRUL3Z"
