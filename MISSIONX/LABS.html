            <h3>ENTER THE LABS</h3>

            <p>You decide to see what you can learn in the labs. As you enter there are three scientists currently working. They don’t seem to notice you. You approach them and manage to get your knife around one of their throats. 
                
                <br><br>"Open the cells, now." You demanded hastily. 
                
                <br><br>You notice there are cots around the room and quickly realzie that these scientists are being held captive as well. They are terrified of your presence but don’t seem interested in calling the guards. Maybe you could cooperate with them. Their reactions could be a facade however and you can avoid a possible backstabbing by killing them. You need to make a decision, and fast.
