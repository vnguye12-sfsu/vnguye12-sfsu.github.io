            <h3>ELIMINATE THE GUARDS</h3>

            <p>You’ve decided the better of the two decisions is to kill the guards. On the fly you make the decision to hide the bodies in a nearby bush to lower your chances of being caught. While you’re moving the bodies you notice they have security cards attached to them. 
                
                <br><br>"This is my way in," you think to yourself.
