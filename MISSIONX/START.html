            <p>You arrive on scene behind HRVST's research headquarters, you notice that the back door has minimal security. You have your knife unsheathed. <BR><BR>“Killing the guards is the faster way” you think to yourself, “however, I risk the bodies being found. If I am patient enough I can easily sneak past them as they come in and out of the facility.”
