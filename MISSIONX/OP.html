            <h3>ATTEMPT ESCAPE</h3>

            <p>You continue to attempt to find the exit route but the time lost gathering the girls is obvious. The guards are rounding the corner.
<BR><BR>
As you are surrounded by the security, they take hold of all the girls. Separated from you the guards raise their weapons towards you. You realize the mistake you’ve made and the lives you’ve risked. <BR><BR>They fire.
