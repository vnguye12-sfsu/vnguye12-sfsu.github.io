            <h3>SAVE TARGET ONLY</h3>

            <p>You push aside your emotions and decide to follow the mission orders. You think to yourself, “If she is alive now, she will survive longer. I can come back and save her.”  You turn back around to retrieve TARGET #9152, she's only about 4 years of age.
                
    
                <br><br>
             You quickly escort the terrified target back up to ground level up the emergency stairs. The alarms start to ring, it seems like someone noticed there has been an intruder. 
                
                <br><br>You can hear hundreds of foot steps moving within the facility. Luckily, your quick decision making skills has given you the upperhand. You see the exit.
